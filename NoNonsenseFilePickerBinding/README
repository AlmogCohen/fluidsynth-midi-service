This directory contains a very simple build script to build
NoNonsenseFilePicker and bindings.
The Java library is at https://github.com/spacecowboy/NoNonsense-FilePicker

The binding project and the git repo already contains a prebuilt binary
so that it does not have to be part of the entire build.
